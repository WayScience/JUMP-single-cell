#Identify single-cell anomalies
This analysis identifies JUMP anomalies after sampling and training processed JUMP data.
Anomalyze is trained on 6 combinations of processed data:
- Normalized single-cell QC'd data
- Normalized single-cell non-QC'd data
- Normalized and feature-selected single-cell QC'd data
- Normalized and feature-selected single-cell non-QC'd data
- QC'd data aggregated to the well level before feature-selection
- Non-QC'd data aggregated to the well level after feature-selection
- Non-QC'd data aggregated to the well level before feature-selection
- QC'd data aggregated to the well level after feature-selection
