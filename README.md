# JUMP-single-cell

Single cell analysis of the JUMP Cell Painting consortium data.
Please ensure adequate storage as the sqlite plate data is approximately 1.1 TB large.

## 0.download_data

This folder contains the code and metadata file to download the plate data from aws.
For more information on how the plate paths were generated please review the `0.generate_jump_dataset_manifest.ipynb` file.

To download the data, first run `0.generate_jump_dataset_manifest.ipynb`, to generate the paths data, then run `1.download_jump_single_cell_profiles.ipynb` to download the plate data.

## 1.process_data

In this step, we merged the single cell data using pycytominer, and the reference plate data located in the `reference_plate_data` folder in the root of the git directory.
The metadata files in this folder can be located by following this aws link:
`https://cellpainting-gallery.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html#cpg0000-jump-pilot/source_4/workspace/metadata/external_metadata/`

The platemaps files in this folder can be found using this aws link:
`https://cellpainting-gallery.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html#cpg0000-jump-pilot/source_4/workspace/metadata/platemaps/2020_11_04_CPJUMP1/platemap/`

Similarly the barcode file `barcode_platemap.csv` came from dropbox.

After merging the single cells, each of the features of the plate data were normalized by pycytominer and converted to parquet files.

## 2.evaluate_data

In this step, we perform inferencing with the pre-trained shuffled and unshuffled logistic regression models from the phenotypic profiling repository `https://github.com/WayScience/phenotypic_profiling_model/tree/main`.
We generate predicted probabilities for each cell expressing one of the fifteen possible phenotypes.
This data in addition to the other single-cell metadata is stored as a parquet file.

## 3.analyze_data

To understand each treatments ability to induce each of the 15 phenotypes, we perform post hoc testing with the probabilities between each of the treatments and the control (DMSO).
These probabilities were generated in `2.evaluate_data`.
In each of these tests we compute the median to determine the directionality of significance among treatments.
We compare phenotypic expressions between treatments by visualizing volcano plots for each (phenotype, statistical test, model type, treatment type) combination.
